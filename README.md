# 5-day-weather-forecast-app

## Description
This project was not based on starter code and was built from scratch. This is a site showcasing the weather for the current day and a five day forecast based on the city the user inputs. I found this project to be a lot more in depth and difficult than any of the other projects that I have made before. I hope that what I have done so far will help any others further their own development.

## Usage
When a user types a city into the input box and clicks the search button, a button will appear under the input box, which the user can click to research that city. Once a city is searched, it will feed that through the first api fetch and gather the coordinates for that city. Once the coordinates have been fetched, they will be fed into two separate functions to gather the weather data for the current day and the next five days. This array of information will then be input into two more functions to display the information, along with creating individual cards for the forecast. Included in the information gathered is the temperature in farenheit, the wind speed, and the humidity, along with the current date and the time each information is gathered, noon. I included for the content to be responsive for all screen sizes, even the input box.
